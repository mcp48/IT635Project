IT 635 Project
This project will list various flight arrival and departure times; both the scheduled times and the arrival times.  If the flight is delayed, a brief reason for the delay will also be listed.  For this project, I chose to use United Airlines flights, as I was familiar with their website, and know that if a flight is delayed, United usually gives the reason why they were delayed.  If a flight is consistently late, operations personnel would have to decide if it is worth keeping the flight on the schedule if it is constantly arriving late to the destination.

The same flights were tracked for a period of about one week in March.  This was right around the time the pandemic started to hit, and airlines started cancelling flights, so I did not track past this period, as I had hoped to do, as I figured most flights would be listed as "cancelled."

Admins or other personnel of the airlines can use the "delays" table to see what flights were delayed, what dates they were delayed, and what the reasons were for the delays.  They will also be able to see if there were any "patterns" or coincidences in determining causes if multiple flights were delayed on the same day, or if the same flight was delayed on consecutive days.
